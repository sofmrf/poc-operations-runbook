# poc-operations-runbook
Sample runbook and monitoring notes for proof-of-concept technical tests
POC Operations Runbook (Sample)

This repository contains example documentation showing how proof-of-concept (POC) technical tests can be structured from an operational perspective. The goal is to demonstrate runbook thinking, monitoring awareness, and clear communication practices for early-stage systems.

Scope
